## What you'll be building
Daily Dose of Definitions is a definitions app. Add new words to your vocabulary every day.  

Using the random word generator, you can learn new words, and if you come across a word you've already added to your vocabulary, just press the Refresh button to get a new word.

Not only will you learn new words with the random word generator, but if you need to quickly look up definitions for a certain word, enter the word and you'll receive a list of definitions. 

Select the specific definition that fits your needs most to get even more context such as any available Synonyms, Antonyms, or Examples.
